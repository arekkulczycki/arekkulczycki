### Hello!

I'm professionally a python backend developer, however I have a much wider spectrum of interests in software. I have the deepest love towards creating things that are visible and intuitively understandable. I always choose to work on something that is related to my daily life. For this reason in my free time I develop projects outside of my professional expertise, like 
* (2024-currently) my latest sin - a videogame in Godot using Kotlin (as if I couldn't ever use the default)
* (2021-currently) a [website for playing Hex](https://github.com/arekkulczycki/hex-forest), my favourite board game, offering an option to play vs **[my custom AI](https://github.com/arekkulczycki/hackable-engine)**
* (2020) a [mobile app](https://github.com/arekkulczycki/ursus_android_app) that organized my football team calendar, keeping track of participants of each event
* (2019-2020) electronic gadgets based on ESP32 and micropython framework

### About me

**My fundamentals**
I code in Python 7 years professionally and over 10 years privately. From small microservices built upon FastAPI, through monoliths using Django, to higihly performant multiprocessing workhorses - I've done it all.

**Being a team player**
Literally, as for many years my top activity has been playing and coaching football. For the last 4 years I've worked in Agile culture and I find it my favourite way of management. Cooperation and mutual reviews are my core values in order todevelop and deliver quality products.

**Flexibility**
Across many projects I developed using various languages such as Kotlin, Java, Go, C#, PHP, NodeJS. CI/CD is no stranger to me, including tools such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Ansible. I deployed maintained production solutions in cloud (AWS, Heroku), or dedicated servers (Nginx, Apache, Docker).

**Passion**
Among other private projects, as a hobby Iâ€™m developing a chess/hex playing engine based on customly designed tree search and evaluation done with machine learning (PyTorch, Tensorflow, OpenAI) and highly optimized Python. Check it out: [hackable-engine](https://github.com/arekkulczycki/hackable-engine).
